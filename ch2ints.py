Integers
'''

#You can add (+), subtract (-), multiply (*), and divide(/) integers in Py. 

# print(2 + 3)
# print(3 - 2)
# print(2 * 6)
# print(3 / 2)

# #Two **'s represent exponents. 
# #i.e. 3 ** 2 = 9

# print(3 ** 2)

# #Py supports method of operations as well. 
# print(2 + 3*4)
# #this gives me 14. 3*4 = 12, 12 + 2 = 14.
# print((2 + 3) * 4)
# #this gives me 20, (2 + 3) = 5, * 4 = 20. 

'''
Not just integers as whole numbers but there is "float" which can include decimals. 
'''

# print(0.1 + 0.1)
# print(0.1 * 10)

# #Be mindful that you can not concat a string with an int. 
# #If you need to use an int in a string, i.e. "I am " + age " years old" -> "I am " + str(age) + " years old"
# #This makes it so that the data type of "age" goes from being an int to a str so it's possible to concat. 

# print(3 / 2)
#unlike python 2.7, you don't have to add decimals to the division if it goes to decimals. 
#i.e. 3 / 2 = 1.5 but in Py 2.7 you had to add decimals to get 1.5, i.e. print(3 / 2.0)/(3.0 / 2), etc.

Practice
2-8: 
    Write addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division so that all the answers become "8"
2-9:
    Store your favorite number in a variable. Using that variable, create a message that shows your favorite nunber. 
2-10:
    Write comments. 
'''

#2.8
print(5 + 3)
print(10 - 2)
print(2 * 4)
print(16 / 2)

#2.9
fav_num = 12
print("my favorite number is " + str(fav_num) + "!")

#2.10
#Here is a comment for exercise 2-10.
