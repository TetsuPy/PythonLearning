#when a file ends in '.py' it means that the file is in a python file format

message = "hello world"
print(message)

#above here, we assigned "hello world" to message. 
#doing print(message) is the same as print("hello world") because they both hold the same value 

#NAMING AND USING VARIABLES

#can only contain numbers, letters, and underscores. 
#but they can't start with numbers, i.e. chap1 is fine, but 1chap is not a possible variable name 

#i.e. greeting_message is fine but greeting message is not, it will cause errors. 


greeting message = "hello guest"

#greeting is not defined 
#message = Statements but be separated by newlines or semicolons


#key aspect of variable names, short but descriptive. 
#rather than "length_person_name", "name_length" is better.

#Be careful when using lower case "L" and "0" together because the "l" can look like a "1" at first glance. 



#a big key factor is avoiding name errors. 
#a very common one is 
message = "blah"
print(mesage)
NameError: name 'mesage' is not defined. 
currently, 'mesage' does not exist and python is telling you
